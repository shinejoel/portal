In other to run the application you need to run the backend and set ClientPortal.presentation.webapi as startup and then run the frontend angular 

you need to display the list of project (This is how i test) https://localhost:9001/api/v1/Project/GetAllProjects
on the table only show 50 project at a time with a pagination 

you need to change the select user to something more user friendly here you need to populate it with the list of users from the api (https://localhost:9001/api/v1/User/GetMemberFirmUsers)

the next is POST with this we need to pass a Json with the selected data from the table and dropdowns into the JSON that will be sent to the post request on click of button  

the search bar should be able to search based on a part of the project Reference ID name example the ID is (CLN_AUD_2019)we should be able to search AUD from that text and sort the table to only show that 

add the select tickbox to be able to select the project or select all projects that will be passed to the JSON
